#Project Overview - Water Sensor Data Trends - 2014

This interactive Tableau dashboard visualizes key trends and anomalies from a SCADA-based water sensor system. The goal is to provide actionable insights into operational performance, water flow, and equipment behavior to support preventative maintenance and improve system reliability.
The dashboard simulates how a utility operator or engineer might monitor sensor data in real-time to identify irregularities—such as pressure drops, flow fluctuations, or out-of-range readings—that could indicate equipment wear, leaks, or efficiency issues.
